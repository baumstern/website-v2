Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI) is a protocol designed to provide a highly secure e-voting solution. It enables organizations to conduct on-chain voting processes with a significantly reduced risk of cheating, such as bribery or collusion. MACI uses zero-knowledge proofs to implement a receipt-free voting scheme, making it impossible for anyone other than the vote coordinator to verify how a specific user voted. This ensures the correct execution of votes and allows anyone to verify the results. It's particularly beneficial for governance and funding events, where its anti-collusion mechanisms help ensure fair and transparent outcomes.
